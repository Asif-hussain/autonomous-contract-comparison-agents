## Creating Test Images

Since actual scanned contract images cannot be included in this repository, you have two options:

### Option 1: Create Sample Images (Recommended for Testing)

1. Create simple text documents representing contracts using any word processor
2. Include the text structure shown in the "Contract Text Templates" section below
3. Save/export as PDF
4. Convert to JPG or PNG (you can screenshot the PDF or use a PDF-to-image tool)
5. Name them according to the pairs above

### Option 2: Use Your Own Contracts

If you have actual contracts you want to test with:
1. Ensure they don't contain sensitive/proprietary information
2. Scan or photograph them clearly
3. Save as JPG or PNG
4. Place them in this directory with clear naming (e.g., `my_contract_original.jpg`, `my_contract_amendment.jpg`)

## Notes for Testing

1. **Image Quality**: For best results, ensure contract images are:
   - Clear and legible (minimum 300 DPI if scanned)
   - Properly oriented (not rotated or upside down)
   - Well-lit if photographed
   - In supported formats (JPG, PNG, WEBP)

2. **File Naming**: Use descriptive names that indicate the contract pair:
   - `contractX_original.jpg` and `contractX_amendment.jpg`
   - Or `company_contract_v1.jpg` and `company_contract_v2.jpg`

3. **Testing Different Scenarios**: Create variations to test:
   - Simple single-section changes
   - Complex multi-section amendments
   - Complete clause additions/deletions
   - Formatting and renumbering changes

4. **Privacy**: Never use actual confidential contracts without proper authorization
